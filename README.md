## Hi there 👋
I thrive at the command line, automate the mundane, and think several steps ahead — whether it’s in data models, home security, cybersecurity, smart infrastructure, or financial independence.
In short: I am the CTO of my life — building apps, running ops, securing systems, and keeping legacy (and family) running strong.
